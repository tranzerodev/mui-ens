// TODO: Add in Account Settings
// https://app.zeplin.io/project/5e786802487fa56ab428bdbe/screen/5e786900b6cb04625ea27d6a: Account Settings and Orders are subpages under the mock. However, a request has been made for both to be separate pages, i.e. instead of /account/orders and /account/settings, we will have /orders and settings, even though both share the same layout

const Account: React.SFC = () => {
  return <div>Account Settings</div>
}

export default Account
