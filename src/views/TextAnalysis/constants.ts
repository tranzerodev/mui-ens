  paraOne: `Evaluating writing has never been more efficient. Assisting
    you with our Writing & Reading checker, you can quickly
    analyse grammatical range, accuracy, and lexical levels. No
    more reading the passage many times to check for each
    criteria like grammatical errors and accuracy. Evaluating
    lexical levels can be tedious and tricky as you need to assess
    the passage carefully while referring to a benchmark or level.
    This can be even more challenging when the learner has
    differing receptive and productive levels. Moreover,
    evaluating writing work can be an enormous task when you
    have many written assignments to mark and need a baseline
    and reference points for grading.`,
  paraTwo: `EnglishSmith’s Writing & Reading checker helps you analyse
    the written work so that you can focus on identifying gaps and feedback areas for improvement. A Reading passage can come in forms, be it a newspaper or magazine article, research journal, blog post, extract from books, etc. Finding the suitable level of text for the learner can be tricky. If the text is too advance or easy, the learner might be disengaged.
    EnglishSmith’s Writing & Reading checker helps you analyse
    the reading text to an estimated level so that you know the
    lexical level and grammatical range is appropriate for the
    learner`,
